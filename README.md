* This App will try to book the first available slot for a Vaccine Center
* Add beneficiaries to the account from [here](https://www.cowin.gov.in) before using this app. Currently this app does not support adding beneficiaries.
* You have to download the Appointment PDF from [here](https://www.cowin.gov.in) after an appointment is booked.
* Currently this app supports booking the First Dose of vaccine only. Second dose support coming soon.
